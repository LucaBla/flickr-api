# FLICKR API

## Description
I made this Project to learn how to use APIs in Rails.
Its an App where you can enter a UserId and you will get the users flickr photos as a result.
Entering no Id will result in showing the latest uploaded photos on flickr.

## Demo
Try it [here.](https://limitless-temple-54188.herokuapp.com/) <br/>
note: it takes about 30 seconds for heroku to load the webapp.
